# 4. Hash Table

DBMS allocates pages from disk into buffer pool

Now we need to consider how the DBMS's execution engine to read/write data from pages



Two types of data structures:

+ Hash Tables
+ Trees



### Design Decision

**Data Organization**

-> How we layout data structure in memory/pages and what information to store to support efficient access



**Concurrency**

-> How to enable multiple threads to access the data structure at the same time without causing problems



## Hash Tables

A **Hash table** implements an unordered associative array that maps keys to values



It uses a hash function to compute an offset into the array for a given key, from which the desired value can be found



Space Complexity: O(n)

Time Complexity: Average O(1)



### Static Hash Table

Allocate giant array that has one slot for every element you need to store

Mod the key by the number of elements to find the offset in the array



#### Assumptions

You need to know the number of elements ahead of time -> To create the correct size of array

Each key is unique

Perfect hash function -> Hash function map key uniquely to the value



#### Design Decision #1: Hash Function

+ How to map a large key space into a smaller domain (array)
+ Trade-off between being fast vs. collision rate (two different value has same key)

#### Design Decision #2: Hashing Scheme

+ How to handle key collisions after hashing
+ Trade-off between allocating a large hash table vs. additional instructions to find/insert keys



## Hash Functions

For any input key, return an integer representation of that key



We want something that is **fast** and has **low collision** rate

The current state-of-art hash function is XXHash3



## Static Hashing Schemes

A static hash scheme is one where the size of the hash table is fixed

This means that if the DBMS runs out of storage space in the hash table, then it has to rebuild a larger hash table from scratch

The new hash table is twice the size of the original hash table



Approach #1: Linear Probe Hashing

Approach #2: Robin Hood Hashing

Approach #3: Cuckoo Hashing



### 1. Linear Probe Hashing

Single giant table of slots

Resolve collision by linearly searching for the next free slot in the table

当出现key冲突时，向下寻找下一个可用的空闲位置

当查询到底部则开始从头部往下进行遍历，进行一个 full loop

+ To determine whether an element is present, hash to a location in the index and scan for it
+ Must store the key in the index to know when to stop scanning
+ Insertions and deletions are generalizations of lookups



Deletion: 删除某个key可能会导致某个冲突位置的key向下查询到空的位置并认为整个hash table中不存在要删除的key

Solution: 

+ **Tombstone** - Insert some value（占位值） to indicate the position is not empty but is deleted so that wont terminate early
+ **Movement** - After deletion, move all other values up to remove the empty slot
  + 向上移动可能导致某个在正确位置的条目，即 key 等于所在位置，移动到错误的位置
  + 解决方案：REHASH，对删除位置以下所有的条目进行 REHASH



#### Non-Unique Keys

**Choice #1: Separate Linked List**

-> Instead of storing the values with the keys, we store a pointer to a separate storage area which contains a linked list of all the values

**Choice #2: Redundant Keys**

-> Simply store the same key multiple times in the table. Everything with linear probing still works



### 2. Robin Hood Hashing

Variant of linear probe hashing that steals slots from "rich" keys and give them to "poor" keys

+ Each key tracks the number of positions they are from where its optimal position in the table
+ On insert, a key takes the slot of another key if the first key is farther away from its optimal position than the second key



Each key also records the "distance" they are from their optimal position

On each insert, if the key being inserted would be farther away from their optimal position at the current slot than the current entry's distance

Replace the current entry and continue trying to insert the ole entry farther down the table



### 3. Cuckoo Hashing

Use multiple hash tables with different hash function seeds

+ On insert, check every table and pick anyone that has a free slot
+ If no table has a free slot, evict the element from one of them and then re-hash it find a new location

Look-ups and deletions are always O(1) because only one location per hash table is checked

**In rare case, we may end up in a cycle** -> Rehash every thing, change hash function -> Make sure every key has a fitted slot



#### Observation

The previous hash tables require the DBMS to know the number of elements it wants to store

-> Otherwise, it must rebuild the table if it needs to grow/shrink the size



## Dynamic Hash Tables

Dynamic hash tables resize themselves on demand

+ Chained Hashing
+ Extendible Hashing
+ Linear Hashing



### 1. Chained Hashing

Maintain a liked list of **buckets** for each slot in the hash table

Resolve collisions by placing all elements with the same hash key into the same bucket

+ To determine whether an element is present, hash to its bucket and scan for it
+ Insertions and deletions are generalizations of lookups

即每个 hash table 中的 entry 都有一个单独的 Linked List 用来记录相同 key 值的数据



### 2. Extendible Hashing

Improved variant of chained hashing that **splits buckets** instead of **letting chains to grow** forever

Multiple slot locations can point to the same bucket chain



The core idea is to move bucket entries on split and increase the number of bits to examine to find entries in the hash table

DBMS only has to move data within the buckets of the split chain



The DBMS maintains a global and local depth bit counts that determine the number bits needed to find buckets in the slot array

通过设置bit的长度来区分不同的hash值，例如：global == 2 -> 00, 01, 10, 11 分别为不同的值

每个local count都表示在这个bucket中的hash值都有相同的bit count的位数



When bucket is full, the DBMS splits the bucket and reshuffle its elements

If the local depth of the split bucket is less than the global depth, then the new bucket is just added to the existing slot array

Otherwise the DBMS double the size of the slot array to accommodate the new bucket and increments the global depth counter

如果 local counter 和 global counter 相同，那么将**原有的这个应该被添加新元素但是已经满了的bucket**变成两个新的buckets

并将 local counter 和 global counter 自增，得到一个新的 bit counts 用来区分 hash 值

对于其他的bucket，如果 local counter 小于 global counter 则长度不变，但是会有原来两倍的 pointers 指向这些 buckets

如果 local counter 小于 global counter bucket 被填满了，则原来的bucket变成两个新的buckets，同时counter自增

### 3. Linear Hashing

Instead of immediately splitting a bucket when it overflows, this scheme maintains a *split pointer* that keeps track of the next bucket to split

No matter whether this pointer is pointing to a bucket that overflowed, the DBMS always splits

The overflow criterion is left up to the implementation



+ When any bucket overflows, split the bucket at the pointer location by adding a new slot entry, and create a new hash function
+ If the hash function maps to slot that has previously been pointed to by pointer, apply the new hash function
+ When the pointer reaches last slot, delete original hash function and replace it with a new hash function



## Conclusion

Fast data structures that support O(1) look-ups that are used all throughout DBMS internals

+ Trade-off between speed and flexibility



Hash table are usually **Not** what you want to use for a table index...
