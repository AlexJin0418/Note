## Disk Based Architecture

The DBMS assumes that the primary storage location of the database is on **non-volatile disk**

> Volatile memory: 易失性存储器，指当电流中断后，所存储的资料便会消失的电脑存储器
>
> 不同于非易失性存储器，后者电源供应中断后，存储器所存储的资料也不会消失，只要重新供电后，就能够读取内存资料

The DBMS's components manage the movement of data between non-volatile and volatile storage



### Storage Hierarchy

From **Faster / Smaller / Expensive** to **Slower / Larger / Cheaper**

CPU Registers -> CPU Cache -> DRAM -> SSD -> HDD -> Network storage

| ------------- Volatile Memory  -----------|    | ------------ Non - volatile ----------- |



#### Volatile Memory:

+ Random Access
+ Byte - Addressable
+ Lose data when power outage



#### Non - Volatile Memory:

+ Sequential Access
+ Block - Addressable
+ Data maintain on disk



> Random Access vs. Sequential Access: 
>
> Random Access：直接访问，指通过下标或特定位置直接访问到存储的目标，例如 Array
>
> Sequential Access：串行访问，指需要遍历前序直到找到目标，例如 Linked - List
>
> 
>
> RAM (Random Access Memory) 使用存储阵列来存储数据，只要给出行地址和列地址，就能确定目标数据，这一过程和目标所处的物理位置无关

### Access Time

L1 Cache Ref access time is about 0.5 ns roughly 0.00000000005 sec

DRAM access time is 100 ns

SSD is about 150,000 ns

HDD is about 10,000,000 ns



### System Design Goal

Allow the DBMS to manage database that exceed the amount of memory available

Reading / Writing to disk is expensive, so it must be managed carefully to avoid large stalls and performance degradation

Random access on disk is usually much slower than sequential access, so the DBMS will want to maximize sequential access



## Disk - Oriented DBMS

![Disk_oriented_dbms](C:\Users\liang\Desktop\Computer_Science_Interview\.assets\Computer_database\disk_oriented_dbms.png)



The database is all on disk, and the data in database files is organized into pages

DBMS needs to bring the data into memory by having a *buffer pool* that manages the data movement back and forth between disk and memory

DBMS also has an execution engine that will execute queries

The buffer pool manager will ensure that the page is there while the execution engine operates on that part of memory



数据在磁盘中以 Pages 的形式存在

DBMS 将磁盘中的数据拷贝到内存的 Buffer Pool 中

当执行引擎想要获取某个数据时，它将向内存中的 Buffer Pool 查询

DBMS 以这种形式保证能够操作超过内存容量大小的数据



使用 Buffer Pool 来与 Disk 中保存的 Pages 进行置换类似于 OS 中使用虚拟内存映射物理内存达到对超过内存大小的数据进行管理



## Why not use the OS?

The high-level design goal of the DBMS is to support database the exceed the amount of memory available

The DBMS can use memory mapping (`mmap`) to store the contents of a file into the address space of a program

+ when `mmap` hits a page fault, the page will be blocked

However, using OS file system will cause large amount of stalls for DBMS

The OS is responsible for moving the pages of the file in and out of memory, so the DBMS doesn't need to worry about it



>  [mmap - Linux](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html)



使用 OS 代替 DBMS 进行页面置换的问题在于 OS 并不知道我们需要哪些页面

而且在进行页面置换时 DBMS 需要等待 OS 完成才能继续进行查询

It is complicated when there are multiple writers

DBMS 需要更高的权限以及更灵活的方式来管理页面



There are some solutions to this problem:

- `madvise:` Tell the OS how you expect to read certain pages
- `mlock:` Tell the OS that memory ranges cannot be paged out
- `msync:` Tell the OS to flush memory ranges out to disk



DBMS always wants to control things itself and can do better job than the OS

+ Flushing dirty pages to disk in the correct order
+ Specialized prefetching
+ Buffer replacement policy
+ Thread / process scheduling



## File Storage

The DBMS stores a database as one or more files on disk

- The OS doesn't know anything about the contents of these files
- Only the DBMS knows how to decipher their contents



DBMS 对其页面存储方式有着唯一性，不同的 DBMS 页面无法互相被读取



The storage manager is responsible for maintaining a database's files

DBMS represents the files as a collection of pages

It also keeps track of what data has been read and written to pages as well how much free space there in these pages



## Database Pages

A **Page** is a fixed - size block of data

- It can contain tuples, meta - data, indexes, log records...
- Most systems do not mix page types
- Some systems require a page to be self - contained



Each page is given a unique identifier

- The DBMS uses an indirection layer to map page IDs to physical locations



Three different notions of "Pages" in a DBMS:

- Hardware Page (usually 4KB) - largest block of data that the storage device can guarantee failsafe writes
- OS Page (usually 4KB)
- Database Page (512B - 16KB)



## Database Heap

A **Heap page** is an unordered collection of pages with tuples that are stored in random order

- Create / Get / Write / Delete Page
- Must also support iterating over all pages



> 堆文件是最简单，最基本的存储方式
>
> 在堆文件中，记录将插入文件末尾，插入记录时不需要对记录进行排序 unordered



Two ways to represent a heap file:

+ Linked List
+ Page Directory



### Linked List

Maintain a **header page** at the beginning of the file that stores two pointers:

+ HEAD of the **free page list** 指向空闲列表的HEAD
+ HEAD of the **database page list** 指向数据页面的HEAD

Each page keeps track of how many free slots they current have



### Page Directory

The DBMS maintains special pages that tracks the location of data pages in the database file

The directory also records the number of free slots per page

Must make sure that the directory pages are in sync with the data pages

类似于一张表保存了所有 Pages 的位置以及可用空间



## Page Layout

#### Header

Every page contains a **header** of meta - data about the page's contents

+ Page Size
+ Checksum
+ DBMS Version
+ Transaction Visibility
+ Compression Information



Some systems require pages to be self - contained 



### How to store tuples in page?

#### Slotted Pages

+ The most common layout scheme is called **slotted pages**
+ The slot array maps "slots" to the tuples' starting position offsets
+ The header tracks of:
  + The # of used slots
  + The offset of the starting location of the last slot used

+ Header 后保存一个 slot array 来记录每一个 tuple 的 offset

#### Log-Structured

+ DBMS only store log records
+ Stores records to file of how the database was modified
+ To read a record, DBMS scans the log file backwards and "recreates" the tuple
+ Fast writes, potentially slow read
+ Works well on append-only storage since its always append new records



## Tuple Layout

A tuple is essentially a sequence of bytes

It is the DBMS's job to interpret those bytes into attribute types and values



**Tuple header:**

Contains meta - data about the tuple

+ Visibility
+ Bit map for NULL values



**Tuple Data:**

Actual data for attributes

+ Attributes are typically stored in the order that you specify them when you create the table
+ Most DBMSs do not allow a tuple to exceed the size of a page



**Unique Identifier:**

+ Each tuple in the database is assigned a unique identifier
+ Most common: `page_id + offset`
+ An application cannot rely on these ids to mean anything



If two tables are related, the DBMS can "pre-join" them, so the table ends up on the same page

This makes reads faster since the DBMS only has to load in one page rather than two separate pages

However, it makes updates more expensive since the DBMS needs more space for each tuple



## Data Representation

The data in a tuple is essentially just byte arrays

It's the job of the DBMS to interpret those bytes into attribute types and values

A *data representation* scheme is how a DBMS stores the bytes for a value



#### 5 High - level datatypes that can be stored in tuples:

+ **Integers**
  + C/C++ native types: INTEGER, BIGINT, SMALLINT, TINYINT
+ **Variable - precision numbers**
  + Inexact, variable - precision numeric types: FLOAT, REAL/DOUBLE
  + CPU can execute instructions on them directly
  + Faster to compute than arbitrary precision numbers
  + May be rounding errors due to its inexact
+ **Fixed - point precision numbers**
  + Numeric data types with arbitrary precision and scale
  + Exact, variable - length binary representation with additional meta - data
  + Used when rounding errors are unacceptable
  + Pay performance penalty to get accuracy
+ **Variable length values**
  + Data with arbitrary length: VARCHAR, VARBINARY, TEXT, BLOB
  + Stored with a header the keeps track of the length of the string
  + Most DBMSs don't allow a tuple to exceed the size of a single page
  + Able to uses a separate **Overflow** storage page with pointers to additional pages
  + Some system will allow to store media files in an external file to save space
  + DBMS cannot manipulate the contents of an external file
    + No durability protections
    + No transaction protections
+ **Date / times**
  + Unix epoch: TIME, DATE, TIMESTAMP



### System Catalogs

A DBMS stores meta - data about database in its internal catalog

+ Table, columns, indexes, views
+ Users, permissions
+ Internal statistics



Internal catalog 保证了 DBMS 能够获得其保存的数据的类型

可使用 `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` 来获取 Internal catalog



## Database Workloads

**Workload** is the general nature of requests a system will have to handle



#### On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP)

Fast operations that only read/update a small amount of data each time

Simple queries that operate on single entity at a time

Handle more writes than reads

例如根据用户 id 获取用户的资料，或者更新用户资料中的某个属性



#### On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)

Complex queries that read a lot of data to compute **aggregates**

Read large portions of the database together

例如查询数据库中有多少个 entity 拥有某个相同的属性值



#### Hybrid Transaction + Analytical Processing

New type of workload more like a combination which tries to do OLTP and OLAP together on the same database



## Storage Models

The DBMS can store tuples in different ways that are better for either OLTP or OLAP workloads

We have assumed the **n-array storage model** so far



### N-Array Storage Model (NSM)

DBMS stores all attributes for a single tuple contiguously in a single page

This approach is ideal for OLTP workloads where requests are insert - heavy and transactions tend to operate only individual entity

Only take one fetch to locate target entity

![NSM](C:\Users\liang\Desktop\Computer_Science_Interview\.assets\Computer_database\NSM.png)

#### Advantages

+ Fast insert, updates, and deletes
+ Good for queries that need the entire tuple

#### Disadvantages

+ Not good for scanning large portions of the table
+ Need to fetch entire disk page



### Decomposition Storage Model (DSM)

DMBS stores the values of a single attribute for all tuples contiguously in a page - "Column store"

Ideal for OLAP workloads where read-only queries perform large scans over a subset of the table's attributes

![DSM](C:\Users\liang\Desktop\Computer_Science_Interview\.assets\Computer_database\DSM.png)

#### Advantages

+ Reduces the amount of wasted work during query execution because the DBMS only reads the data that its needs for query
+ Enables better compression because all of the values for the same attribute are stored contiguously

#### Disadvantages

+ Slow for point queries, inserts, updates, and deletes because of tuple splitting



#### Tuple Identification

Since single attributes are stored contiguously in one page, there needs a way to identify which attribute belongs to which entity

There are two common approaches:

+ **Fixed - length offsets**
  + More common
  + Attributes are all fixed-length
  + DBMS can compute the offset of the attribute for each tuple
  + Use pad fields or dictionary to deal with variable - length fields like STRING or BLOB
+ **Embedded Tuple Ids**
  + Less common
  + Stores a tuple id for every attribute in the columns
  + Need extra space for store attribute ids in tuples
