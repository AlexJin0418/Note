# Tree Indexes

Tree Indexes are designed to support the DBMS's execution engine to read/write data from pages in the buffer pool



A **table index** is a replica of a subset of a table's columns that is organized and/or sorted for efficient access using a subset of those attribute

Instead of performing a sequential san, the DBMS can lookup the table index's auxiliary data structure to find tuples more quickly

The DBMS ensures that the contents of the tables and the indexes are always logically in sync



Trade-off: 

+ More indexes makes looking up queries faster
+ Indexes also use storage and require maintenance



## B+ Tree

There is a specific data structure called a **B-Tree** to refer **Balanced tree data structure**

A B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allow searches, sequential access, insertion, and deletion (O(log(n)))

+ It is perfectly balanced - every leaf node is at the same depth in the tree
+ Every node other than the root is at least half full - M/2 - 1 <= #keys <= M - 1
+ Every Inner node with k keys has k + 1 non-null children



It is optimized for disk-oriented DBMS's that read/write large blocks of data

Generally it is a binary search tree

#### Difference between B-Tree and B+ Tree

The primary difference between the original B-Tree and the B+ Tree is that 

B - Trees stores keys and values in all nodes

B+ Trees stores values *only in leaf nodes*

> 对于每一个查找的值，B+ Tree 都需要从根节点到叶子节点找一遍
>
> 时间复杂度与树的高度成正比

#### Structure of B+ Tree

Every node in a B+ Tree contains an array of **key/value pairs**

The keys in these pairs are derived from the attributes that the index is based on

The values will differ based on whether a node is an inner node or a leaf node:

+ Inner node:
  + Value array will contain pointers to other node
  + 只保存 key 值，value 数组指向其对应的叶子节点
+ Leaf node:
  + Two approaches for leaf values:
    + **Record IDs:** Refer to a pointer to the location of the tuple 使用指针指向叶子节点的值
    + **Tuple Data:** Store the actual contents of the tuple in each node 保存值在叶子节点中

B+ Tree 的每一个 node 均保存一组 key/value 对

在 inner node 中，每一个键值对表示为 `<node*> | <key>` 的形式，其中 key 表示其 leaf nodes 值的最小值，value 保存了指针指向其 leaf nodes 的起始位置

在 leaf node 中，每一个键值对表示为 `<value> | <key>` 的形式，其中 key 表示该键值对的 key 值，value 存储了键值对的 value



#### Representation of B+ Tree Leaf Node

B+ Tree 的 leaf node 可以表示为两种形式

1. 一个数组，其中数组起始和末尾表示为指向上一个和下一个 leaf node 的指针，中间部分保存了所有的 key/value 对
2. 使用 header 保存 meta-data 例如 levels, slots, pointers；使用两个数组分别保存 keys 和 values



## B+ Tree Operations



### Selection Conditions

B+ Trees are in sorted order, look ups have fast traversal and also do not require the entire key

The DBMS can use a B+ Tree index if the query provides any of attributes of the search key

To perform a prefix search on a B+ Tree, one looks at the first attribute on the key

Follow the path down and performs a sequential scan across the leaves to find all keys that one wants

当给出一个键值时，可以通过 inner node 确定对应值的范围

之后再通过 sequential scan 找到做需要的值

同时支持前缀查找，因为 inner node 保存的是一个范围值，所以找到前缀后即可定位所有满足条件值的范围



### Insertion

Find correct leaf node `L`

Put data entry into `L` in sorted order

If `L` has enough space, done!

Otherwise, split `L` keys into `L` and a new node `L2`

+ Redistribute entries evenly, **copy up middle key**
+ Insert index entry pointing to `L2` into parent of `L`
+ 将 `L` 一分为二，前部由 first - mid - 1，后部由 mid - last
+ 将 middle 的值存入 `L` 的父节点中并指向 `L2`



### Deletion

Start at root, find leaf `L` where entry belongs

Remove the entry

If `L` is at least half-full, done!

If `L` has only `M/2-1` entries:

+ Try to re-distribute, borrowing from sibling - adjacent node with same parent as `L`
+ If re-distribution fails, merge `L` and sibling



If merge occurs, must delete entry pointing to `L` from the parent of `L`



### Duplicate Keys

There are two approaches to duplicate keys in a B+ Tree

+ **Append IDs:**
  + Append record Ids as part of the key
  + Since each tuple's record ID is unique, this will ensure that all the keys are identifiable
+ **Overflow nodes:**
  + Allow leaf nodes to spill into overflow nodes that contain the duplicate keys
  + This is more complex to maintain and modify
  + 获取新的 overflow nodes 避免了开辟新的空间以及重新分配 values
  + 但是需要考虑添加新的空间后需要对整个 node 进行重新排序



### Clustered Indexes ?

The table is stored in the sort order specified by the primary key

+ Can be either heap - or index - organized storage



Some DBMSs always use a clustered index

+ If a table does not contain a primary key, the DBMS will automatically make a hidden primary key



## B+ Tree Design Choices

Node size

Merge Threshold

Variable-Length Keys

Intra-Node Search



### Node size

The slower the storage device, the larger the optimal node size for a B+ Tree

To reduce the number of seeks needed to find data and amortize the expensive disk read over a large chunk of data

In-memory database use small page size to decrease data fragmentation

-> HDD: ~ 1MB

-> SDD: ~10 KB

-> In-Memory: ~512 B



Optimal size can very depending on the workload

Point queries would prefer as small as a page as possible to reduce the amount of unnecessary extra info loaded

Large sequential scan might prefer large pages to reduce the number of fetches it needs to do

越慢的存储方式使用越大的节点大小来减少对磁盘的读取和写入



### Merge Threshold

Some DBMSs do not always merge nodes when they are half full

Delaying a merge operation may reduce the amount of reorganization

It may also be better to just let smaller nodes exist and then periodically rebuild entire tree



### Variable Length Keys

+ **Pointers**
  + Store the key as pointers to the tuple's attribute
+ **Variable - Length Nodes**
  + The size of each node in the index can vary
  + Requires careful memory management
+ **Padding**
  + Always pad the key to be max length of the key type
+ **Key Map / Indirection**
  + Embed an array of pointers that map to the key + value list within the node



### Intra-Node Search

+ **Linear**
  + Scan from beginning to the end
+ **Binary**
  + Jump to middle key -> ensure Log(n) search
+ **Interpolation**
  + Approximate location of desired key based on known distribution of keys



## Optimization

Prefix Compression

Deduplication

Bulk Insert



### Prefix Compression

Sorted keys in the same leaf node are likely to have the same prefix

Instead of storing the entire key each time, extract common prefix and store only unique suffix for each key

保存相同的前缀，只使用后缀作为 key 值，以此来节省空间



### Deduplication

Non-unique indexes can end up storing multiple copies of the same key in leaf nodes

The leaf node can store the key once and then maintain a list of tuples with that key

对于含有相同键值的值来说，可以将键值放在开头，其余值排列保存



### Bulk Insert

The fastest way to build a new B+ Tree for an existing table is to first sort the keys and then build the index from the bottom up

先排序，生成叶子节点后再生成 inner node 和 root node
