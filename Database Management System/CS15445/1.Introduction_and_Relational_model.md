# 1. Intro & Relational Model

## Database

Database is an organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspect of the real-world



## Database Management System

A database management system (DBMS) is software that allows applications to store and analyze information in a database

A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases



## Data models

A **data model** is a collection of concepts for describing the data in a database

+ Most DBMS use relational data model
+ NoSQL includes Key/Value, Graph, Document and Colum-family
+ Machine Learning uses Array/Matrix

A **schema** is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model



## Relational Model

Proposed by Ted Codd in 1970

Database abstraction to avoid this maintenance:

+ Store database in simple data structures
+ Access data through high-level language, DBMS figures out best strategy
+ Physical storage left up to the DBMS implementation



#### Structure:

The definition of the database's relations and their contents

#### Integrity:

Ensure the database's contents satisfy constrains

#### Manipulation: 

Programming interface for accessing and modifying a database's contents



A **relation** is an unordered set that contain the relationship of attributes that represent entities

A **tuple** is a set of attribute values in the relation

A relation's **Primary key** uniquely identifies a single tuple

A **foreign key** specifies that an attribute from one relation has to map to a tuple in another relation



## Data Manipulation Languages (DML)

Methods to store and retrieve information from a database

**Procedural:** The query specifies the high-level strategy, the DBMS should use to find the desired result

**Non-Procedural (Declarative): ** The query specifies only what data is wanted and not how to find it



## Queries

The relational model is independent of any query language implementation
