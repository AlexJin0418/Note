# Monte Carlo Path Tracing

## Monte Carlo Integration

**why**: we want to solve an integral, but it can be too difficult to solve analytically

Estimate the integral of a function by averaging random samples of the function's value

如果均匀采样，那么 uniform random variable = 1 / (b - a)

Whitted-style ray tracing:
+ Always perform specular reflections / refractions
+ Stop bouncing at diffuse surfaces

Are these simplifications resonable?

Whitted-style ray tracing is wrong, **BUT** the rendering equation is correct

But it involves
+ Solving an integral over the hemisphere, and
+ Recursive execution
